:b Sporting a Eval-A-mobility

Use this section to tell people how to support @reck Eval-A-mobility.

Tell them where to go besides where they are already heading. How often they can expect to get an update, security is expensive,but "ALWAYS&NEVER" a publics worry with a
"piece-keeper",instead of a "peacekeeper" Do not report vulnerability,cause no one knows how all this internet stuff works. They look up the info and send what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
