==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/microg/UnifiedNlp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/microg/UnifiedNlp)

The next generation Network Location Provider, based on plugins. Usually abbreviated as UnifiedNlp.

[![Available on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/wiki/images/c/c4/F-Droid-button_available-on.png)](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.google.android.gms)

Installation
------------
Release builds may be found on the [release page](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/releases).

Unified Network Location Provider is provided in 3 variants:
* NetworkLocation.apk – for the usual configuration of Android 4.4+ without GApps
* LegacyNetworkLocation.apk – for the usual configuration of Android 2.3 - 4.3.1 without GApps
* UnifiedNlp.apk – for Android WITH Gapps

Keep in mind that:
* All three variants are available on F-Droid as well, but they use different apk names (have a look at app description on F-Droid to check which version to use).
* There is another repo containing the [deprecated version](https://github.com/microg/NetworkLocation) of NetworkLocation.apk without the plug-in system.
* [microG GmsCore](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki) project already includes the Unified Network Location Provider.


### Android 4.4 - 7.1.1 (KitKat / Lollipop / Marshmallow / Nougat)
Most modern ROMs come with support for non-Google geolocation providers. On these systems installation is easy:

1. Make sure that no Google geolocation tool is installed (it is usually listed as Google Play Services in Apps)
2. Download and install `NetworkLocation.apk` as a usual app (you may need to enable "Unknown sources" in Settings->Security)
3. Reboot and continue at [Usage](#usage)

Some ROMs, especially those not based on AOSP might have problems using this method. However, if your system has root, you can try installing the hard way:

1. Download `NetworkLocation.apk`
2. Mount `/system` read-write (from your PC, call `adb root && adb remount`)
3. Copy `NetworkLocation.apk` to `/system/priv-app` (from your PC, call `adb push NetworkLocation.apk /system/priv-app/NetworkLocation.apk`)
4. Reboot (from you PC, call `adb reboot`) and continue at [Usage](#usage)

**Note:** On Android 7 (or later) an [additional patch](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/blob/master/patches/android_frameworks_base-N.patch) is needed to make it working, or alternatively, you can install it in `/system/priv-app` as explained above.

### Android 2.3 - 4.3.1 (Gingerbread / Honeycomb / Ice Cream Sandwich / Jelly Bean)
Older Android versions are no longer officially supported. However I still provide a legacy build, that should be compatible with those systems.
It is required to have a rooted system to install on Jelly Bean and older.

1. Download `LegacyNetworkLocation.apk`
2. Mount `/system` read-write (from your PC, call `adb root && adb remount`)
3. Copy `LegacyNetworkLocation.apk` to `/system/app` (from your PC, call `adb push LegacyNetworkLocation.apk /system/app/LegacyNetworkLocation.apk`)
4. Reboot (from you PC, call `adb reboot`) and continue at [Usage](#usage)


Usage
-----
UnifiedNlp alone does not provide any features, but acts as a middleware for multiple backends. Most of them can be downloaded and updated using [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org).
Here is a list of backends known to me.

List of backends for geolocation:
* [AMap UnifiedNlp Backend](https://gitlab.com/fasheng/amap-nlp-backend) - Uses the AMap Location API (a popular location service in China) to resolve locations. The database is proprietary.
* [Apple UnifiedNlp Backend](https://github.com/microg/AppleWifiNlpBackend) - Uses Apple's service to resolve Wi-Fi locations. It has excellent coverage but the database is proprietary.
* [Baidu UnifiedNlp Backend](https://gitlab.com/fasheng/baidu-nlp-backend) - Uses the Baidu Location API (another popular location service in China) to resolve locations. The database is proprietary. 
* [Déjà Vu Location Service](https://github.com/n76/DejaVu) - Uses locally acquired WLAN/WiFi AP and mobile/cellular tower data to resolve user location.
* [LocalGSMLocationProvider](https://github.com/rtreffer/LocalGSMLocationProvider) - Local opencellid based location provider backend. Has been surpassed by LocalGSMBackend which also has an OpenCellID option - *Last update in 2014*
* [LocalGSMBackend](https://github.com/n76/Local-GSM-Backend) - Local location provider for GSM cells. It works offline by downloading freely licensed database files from Mozilla, OpenCellID, or lacells.db. The author is focusing development on the Déjà Vu backend. 
* [LocalWifiNlpBackend](https://github.com/n76/wifi_backend) - Local location provider for Wi-Fi APs using on-phone generated database. The author is focusing development on the Déjà Vu backend.
* [MozillaNlpBackend](https://github.com/microg/IchnaeaNlpBackend) - Uses the Mozilla Location Service to resolve user location. The coverage is OK. Only the cell tower database is free.
* [OpenWlanMapNlpBackend](https://github.com/microg/OpenWlanMapNlpBackend) - Uses OpenWlanMap.org to resolve user location but the NLP backend did not reach release-quality, yet. Users interested in a freely licensed and downloadable database for offline use should stick with openBmap for now - *Last updated in 2015*
* [Radiocells.org UnifiedNlp Backend](https://github.com/wish7code/org.openbmap.unifiedNlpProvider) - Uses [Radiocells.org](https://radiocells.org/) to resolve user location. Community-created, freely licensed database that can optionally be downloaded for offline operation. The coverage [varies from country to country](https://radiocells.org/stats/countries) (it's best in central Europe).

List of backends for (reverse) geocoding:
* [NominatimGeocoderBackend](https://github.com/microg/NominatimGeocoderService) - Address lookup backend.

(...) Create issue or pull request to extend either list :)

After installing a backend, you can use UnifiedNlp by activating network-based geolocation in Settings->Location. 
Since KitKat, you need to select any mode but "device only", on older Android version this setting is called "Wi-Fi & mobile network location" 
(ignore any misleading texts saying this is for Google's location service, you don't have Google's service installed but UnifiedNlp :smile:) 

Backend development
-------------------
The API is available [here](https://github.com/microg/android_external_UnifiedNlpApi). Documentation may be found in the README provided with the API.

You might also take a look into existing backends, to see how they work out.

Building
--------
UnifiedNlp can be easily built using Gradle.

    git clone https://github.com/microg/UnifiedNlp
    cd UnifiedNlp
    ./gradlew build
